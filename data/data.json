{"content":{"leadings":["At YR Media, when we turn our attention to an issue shaping young people’s lives, we go deep. As of fall 2019, that issue is Artificial Intelligence. Leveraging our track-record for producing groundbreaking learning experiences and award-winning media,&nbsp;we are launching a new desk: A.I. in Life.\n","A.I. is a shaping force of the 21st century. It’s got the potential to address some of our biggest challenges and unlock new forms of creativity. But A.I. can also exacerbate humanity’s worst traits, like bias and violence. We are the next generation of A.I. creators and users. We need to understand the technology, embrace its potential, insist on its ethical application, expose its harms and tell its stories.\n","With support from the National Science Foundation and in partnership with stellar university and industry collaborators including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.)’s <a href=\"https://appinventor.mit.edu/\">App Inventor</a> team, we’re producing:\n"],"sections":[{"title":"Mover and Shaker interview series\n","content":"public conversations on YR Media social channels between young people and A.I.’s leading (and hidden) players.
